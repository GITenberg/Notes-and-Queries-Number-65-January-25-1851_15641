<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>TRADITIONAL ENGLISH BALLADS.</h3>

  <p>The task of gathering old traditionary song is surely a pleasant and a
  lightsome one. Albeit the harvest has been plentiful and the gleaners
  many, still a stray sheaf may occasionally be found worth the having. But
  we must be careful not to "pick up a straw."</p>

  <p>One of your corespondents recommends, as an addition to the value of
  your pages, the careful getting together of those numerous traditional
  ballads that are still sometimes to be met with, floating about various
  parts of the country. This advice is by no means to be disregarded, but I
  wish to point out the necessity of the contributors to the undertaking
  knowing something about ballad literature. An acquaintance with the
  ordinary <i>published</i> collections, at least, cannot be dispensed
  with. Without this knowledge we should be only multiplying copies of
  worthless trifles, or reprinting ballads that had already appeared in
  print.</p>

  <p>The traditional copies of old <i>black-letter</i> ballads are, in
  almost all cases (as may easily be seen by comparison), much the worse
  for wear. As a proof of this I refer the curious in these matters to a
  volume of <i>Traditional Versions of Old Ballads</i>, collected by Mr.
  Peter Buchan, and edited by Mr. Dixon for the Percy Society. The Rev. Mr.
  Dyce pronounces this "a volume of <i>forgeries</i>;" but, acquitting poor
  Buchan (of whom more anon) of any intention to deceive, it is, to say the
  least of it, a volume of <i>rubbish</i>; inasmuch as the ballads are all
  worthless modern versions of what had appeared "centuries ago" in their
  <i>genuine</i> shape. Had these ballads <i>not existed in print</i>, we
  should have been glad of them in any form; but, in the present case, the
  publication of such a book (more especially by a learned society) is a
  positive nuisance.</p>

  <p>Another work which I cannot refrain from noticing, called by one of
  the reviewers "A valuable contribution to our stock of ballad
  literature"? is Mr. Frederick Sheldon's <i>Minstrelsy of the English
  Border</i>. The preface to this volume <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span> promises much, as may be
  seen by the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"It is now upwards of forty years since Sir Walter Scott published his
  <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, and during his 'raids,' as he facetiously
  termed his excursions of discovery in Liddesdale, Teviotdale, Tyndale,
  and the Merse, very few ballads of any note or originality could possibly
  escape his enthusiastic inquiry; for, to his love of ballad literature,
  he added the patience and research of a genuine antiquary. Yet, no doubt
  many ballads <i>did</i> escape, and still remain scattered up and down
  the country side, existing probably in the recollection of many a
  sun-browned shepherd, or the weather-beaten brains of ancient hinds, or
  'eldern' women: or in the well-thumbed and nearly illegible leaves of
  some old book or pamphlet of songs, snugly resting on the 'pot-head,' or
  sharing their rest with the 'Great Ha' Bible,' <i>Scott's Worthies</i>,
  or Blind Harry's lines. The parish dominie or pastor of some obscure
  village, amid the many nooks and corners of the Borders, possesses, no
  doubt, treasures in the ballad-ware that would have gladdened the heart
  of a Ritson, a Percy, or a Surtees; in the libraries, too, of many an
  ancient descendant of a Border family, some black-lettered volume of
  ballads, doubtlessly slumbers in hallowed and unbroken dust."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This reads invitingly; the writer then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"From such sources I have obtained may of the ballads in the present
  collection. Those to which I have stood godfather, and so baptized and
  remodelled, I have mostly met with in the 'broad-side' ballads, as they
  are called."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Although the writer here speaks of Ritson and Percy as if he were
  acquainted with their works, it is very evident that he had not looked
  into their contents. The name of Evans' <i>Collection</i> had probably
  never reached him. Alas! we look in vain for the tantalising "pamphlet of
  songs,"&mdash;still, perhaps, snugly resting on the "pot-head," where our
  author in his "poetical dream" first saw it. The "black-lettered volume
  of ballads" too, in the library of the "ancient descendant of a Border
  family," still remains in its dusty repository, untouched by the hand of
  Frederick Sheldon.</p>

  <p>In support of the object of this paper I shall now point out "a few"
  of the errors of <i>The Minstrelsy of the English Border</i>.</p>

  <p>P. 201. <i>The Fair Flower of Northumberland</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"It was a knight in Scotland born,</p>
      <p class="i1">Follow my love, come over the Strand;</p>
      <p>Was taken prisoner, and left forlorn</p>
      <p class="i1">Even by the good Erle Northumberland."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is a corrupt version of Thomas Deloney's celebrated ballad of
  "The Ungrateful Knight," printed in the <i>History of Jack of
  Newbery</i>, 1596, and in Ritson's <i>Ancient Songs</i>, 1790. A Scottish
  version may be found in Kinloch's <i>Ballads</i>, under the title of the
  "The Provost's Daughter." Mr. Sheldon knows nothing of this, but
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This ballad has been known about the English Border for many years,
  and I can remember a version of it being sung by my grandmother!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He also informs us that he has added the last verse but one, in order
  to make the "ends of justice" more complete!</p>

  <p>P. 232. <i>The Laird of Roslin's Daughter</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"The Laird of Roslin's daughter</p>
      <p class="i1">Walk'd through the wood her lane;</p>
      <p>And by her came Captain Wedderburn,</p>
      <p class="i1">A servant to the Queen."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is a wretched version (about half the original length) of a
  well-known ballad, entitled "Captain Wedderburn's Courtship." It first
  appeared <i>in print</i> in <i>The New British Songster</i>, a collection
  published at Falkirk, in 1785. It was afterwards inserted in Jamieson's
  <i>Popular Ballads and Songs</i>, 1806; Kinloch's <i>Ancient Ballads</i>,
  1826; Chambers' <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, 1829, &amp;c. But hear what Mr.
  Sheldon has to say, in 1847:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This is a fragment of an apparently ancient ballad, related to me by
  a lady of Berwick-on-Tweed, who used to sing it in her childhood. I have
  given all that she was able to furnish me with. The same lady assures me
  that she never remembers having seen it in print [!!], and that she had
  learnt if from her nurse, together with the ballad of 'Sir Patrick
  Spens,' and several Irish legends, since forgotten."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>P. 274. <i>The Merchant's Garland</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Syr Carnegie's gane owre the sea,</p>
      <p class="i1">And's plowing thro' the main,</p>
      <p>And now must make a lang voyage,</p>
      <p class="i1">The red gold for to gain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is evidently one of those ballads which calls Mr. Sheldon
  "godfather." The original ballad, which has been "baptized and
  remodelled," is called "The Factor's Garland." It begins in the following
  homely manner:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Behold here's a ditty, 'tis true and no jest</p>
      <p>Concerning a young gentleman in the East,</p>
      <p>Who by his great gaming came to poverty,</p>
      <p>And afterwards went many voyages to sea."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>P. 329. <i>The rare Ballad of Johnnie Faa</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"There were seven gipsies in a gang,</p>
      <p class="i1">They were both brisk and bonny O;</p>
      <p>They rode till they came to the Earl of Castle's house,</p>
      <p class="i1">And here they sang so sweetly O."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is a very <i>hobbling</i> version (from the recitation of a
  "gipsy vagabond") of a ballad frequently reprinted. It first appeared in
  Ramsay's <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>; afterwards in Finlay's and
  Chambers' Collections. None of these versions were known to Mr.
  Sheldon.</p>

  <p>I have now extracted enough from the <i>Minstrelsy of the English
  Border</i> to show the mode of "ballad editing" as pursued by Mr.
  Sheldon. The instances are sufficient to strengthen my position.</p>

  <p>One of the most popular traditional ballads still <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span> floating about
  the country, is "King Henrie the Fifth's Conquest:"&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"As our King lay musing on his bed,</p>
      <p>He bethought himself upon a time,</p>
      <p>Of a tribute that was due from France,</p>
      <p>Had not been paid for so long a time."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was first printed from "oral communication," by Sir Harris Nicolas,
  who inserted two versions in the Appendix to his <i>History of the Battle
  of Agincourt</i>, 2d edition, 8vo. 1832. It again appeared (not from
  either of Sir Harris Nicolas's copies) in the Rev. J.C. Tyler's <i>Henry
  of Monmouth</i>, 8vo. vol. ii. p. 197. And, lastly, in Mr. Dixon's
  <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England</i>,
  printed by the Percy Society in 1846. These copies vary considerably from
  each other, which cannot be wondered at, when we find that they were
  obtained from independent sources. Mr. Tyler does not allude to Sir
  Harris Nicolas's copies, nor does Mr. Dixon seem aware that any
  <i>printed</i> version of the traditional ballad had preceded his. The
  ballad, however, existed in a printed "broad-side" long before the
  publications alluded to, and a copy, "Printed and sold in Aldermary
  Church Yard," is now before me. It is called "King Henry V., his Conquest
  of France in Revenge for the Affront offered by the French King in
  sending him (instead of the Tribute) a ton of Tennis Balls."</p>

  <p>An instance of the various changes and mutations to which, in the
  course of ages, a popular ballad is subject, exists in the "Frog's
  Wedding." The pages of the "NOTES AND QUERIES" testify to this in a
  remarkable degree. But no one has yet hit upon the <i>original</i>
  ballad; unless, indeed, the following be it, and I think it has every
  appearance of being the identical ballad licensed to Edward White in
  1580-1. It is taken from a rare musical volume in my library, entitled
  <i>Melismata; Musicall Phansies, fitting the Court, Citie, and Countrey
  Humours. Printed by William Stansby for Thomas Adams</i>, 1611. 4to.</p>

  <p>From what I have shown, the reader will agree with me, that a
  collector of ballads from oral tradition should possess some acquaintance
  with the labours of his predecessors. This knowledge is surely the
  smallest part of the duties of an editor.</p>

  <p>I remember reading, some years ago, in the writings of old Zarlino (an
  Italian author of the sixteenth century), an amusing chapter on the
  necessary qualifications for a "complete musician." The recollection of
  this forcibly returns to me after perusing the following extract from the
  preface to a <i>Collection of Ballads</i> (2 vols. 8vo. Edinburgh, 1828),
  by our "simple" but well-meaning friend, "Mr. Peter Buchan of
  Peterhead."</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"No one has yet conceived, nor has it entered the mind of man, what
  patience, perseverance, and general knowledge are necessary for an editor
  of a Collection of Ancient Ballads; nor what mountains of difficulties he
  has to overcome; what hosts of enemies he has to encounter; and what
  myriads of little-minded quibblers he has to silence. The writing of
  explanatory notes is like no other species of literature. History throws
  <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>
  little light upon their origin [the ballads, I suppose?], or the cause
  which gave rise to their composition. He has to grope his way in the
  dark: like Bunyan's pilgrim, on crossing the Valley of the Shadow of
  Death, he hears sounds and noises, but cannot, to a certainty, tell from
  whence they come, nor to what place they proceed. The one time, he has to
  treat of fabulous ballads in the most romantic shape; the next,
  legendary, with all its exploded, obsolete, and forgotten superstitions;
  also history, tragedy, comedy, love, war, and so on; all, perhaps, within
  the narrow compass of a few hours,&mdash;so varied must his genius and
  talents be."</p>

  become an Editor of Old Ballads is left amongst us.</p>

<h3>THE FATHER OF PHILIP MASSINGER.</h3>

  <p>Gifford was quite right in stating that the name of the father of
  Massinger, the dramatist, was Arthur, according to Oldys, and not Philip,
  according to Wood and Davies. Arthur Massinger (as he himself spelt the
  name, although others have spelt it Messenger, from its supposed
  etymology) was in the service of the Earl of Pembroke, who married the
  sister of Sir Philip Sidney, in whose family the poet Daniel was at one
  time tutor. I have before me several letters from him to persons of note
  and consequence, all signed "Arthur Massinger;" and to show his
  importance in the family to which he was attached, I need only mention,
  that in 1597, when a match was proposed between the son of Lord Pembroke
  and the daughter of Lord Burghley, Massinger, the poet's father, was the
  confidential agent employed between the parties. My purpose at present is
  to advert to a matter which occurred ten years earlier, and to which the
  note I am about to transcribe relates. It appears that in March, 1587,
  Arthur Massinger was a suitor for the reversion of the office of Examiner
  in the Court of the Marches toward South Wales, for which also a person
  of the name of Fox was a candidate; and, in order to forward the wishes
  of his dependent, the Earl of Pembroke wrote to Lord Burghley as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"My servant Massinger hathe besought me to ayde him in obteyning a
  reversion from her Majestie of the Examiner's office in this courte;
  whereunto, as I willingly have yielded, soe I resolved to leave the
  craving of your Lordship's furtheraunce to his owne humble sute; but
  because I heare a sonn of Mr. Fox (her Majestie's Secretary here) doth
  make sute for the same, and for the Mr. Sherar, who now enjoyethe it, is
  sicklie, I am boulde to desier your Lordship's honorable favour to my
  servaunte, which I shall most kindlie accepte, and he for the same ever
  rest bounde to praye for your Lordship. And thus, leaving further to
  trouble you, &amp;c. 28. March, 1587. H. PEMBROKE."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The whole body of this communication, it is worth remark, is in the
  handwriting of Arthur Massinger (whose penmanship was not unlike that of
  his son), and the signature only that of the Earl, in whose family he was
  entertained. I have not been able to ascertain whether the application
  was successful; and it is possible that some of the records of the court
  may exist, showing either the death of Sherar, and by whom he was
  succeeded about that date, or that Sherar recovered from his illness. As
  I have before said, it is quite clear that Arthur Massinger was high in
  the confidence and service of Lord Pembroke ten years after the date of
  the preceding note.</p>

  <p>I have a good deal more to say about Arthur Massinger, but I must take
  another time for the purpose.</p>

<h3>TOUCHSTONE'S DIAL.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 405.)</p>

  <p>The conjecture of Mr. Knight, in his note to <i>As You Like It</i>,
  and to which your correspondent J.M.B. has so instructively drawn our
  attention, is undoubtedly correct. The "sun-ring" or ring-dial, was
  probably the watch of our forefathers some thousand years previous to the
  invention of the modern chronometer, and its history is deserving of more
  attention than has hitherto been paid to it. Its immense antiquity in
  Europe is proved by its still existing in the <i>remotest</i> and
  <i>least civilised</i> districts of North England, Scotland, and the
  Western Isles, Ireland, and in Scandinavia. I have in my possession
  <i>two</i> such rings, both of brass. The one, nearly half an inch broad,
  and two inches in diameter, is from the Swedish island of Gothland, and
  is of more modern make. It is held by the finger and thumb clasping a
  small brass ear or handle, to the right of which a slit in the ring
  extends nearly one-third of the whole length. A small narrow band of
  brass (about one-fifth of the width) runs along the centre of the ring,
  and of course covers the slit. This narrow band is movable, and has a
  hole in one part through which the rays of the sun can fall. On each side
  of the band (to the right of the handle) letters, which stand for the
  names of the months, are inscribed on the ring as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><img src="images/053a.png" alt="Ring dial 1 - months" /></p>

  <p><i>Inside</i> the ring, opposite to these letters, are the following
  figures for the hours:&mdash;</p>

  <p><img src="images/053b.png" alt="Ring dial 1 - hours" /></p>

  <p>The small brass band was made movable that the ring-click might be
  properly <i>set by the sun</i> at stated periods, perhaps once a
  month.</p>

  <p>The second sun-ring, which I bought in Stockholm in 1847, also "out of
  a deal of old iron," is <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span> smaller and much broader than the first,
  and is perhaps a hundred years older; it is also more ornamented.
  Otherwise its fashion is the same, the only difference being in the
  arrangement of the inside figures, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><img src="images/054.png" alt="Ring dial 2 - hours" /></p>

  <p>The ring recovered by Mr. Knight evidently agrees with the above. I
  hope Mr. K. will, sooner or later, present the curiosity to our national
  museum,&mdash;which will be driven at last, if not by higher motives, by
  the mere force of public opinion and public indignation, to form a
  regularly arranged and grand collection of our own British antiquities in
  every branch, secular and religious, from the earliest times, down
  through the middle ages, to nearly our own days. Such an archæological
  department could count not only upon the assistance of the state, but
  upon rich and generous contributions from British sources, individuals
  and private societies, at home and abroad, as well as foreign help, at
  least in the way of exchange. But any such plan must be <i>speedily</i>
  and <i>well</i> organised and <i>well announced</i>!</p>

  <p>I give the above details, not only because they relate to a passage in
  our immortal bard, who has ennobled and perpetuated every word and fact
  in his writings, but because they illustrate the astronomical antiquities
  of our own country and our kindred tribes during many centuries. These
  sun-dials are now very scarce, even in the high Scandinavian North,
  driven out as they have been by the watch, in the same manner as the
  ancient clog<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  or Rune-staff (the carved wooden perpetual almanac) has been extirpated
  by the printed calendar, and now only exists in the cabinets of the
  curious. In fifty years more sun-rings will probably be quite extinct
  throughout Europe. I hope this will cause you to excuse my prolixity.
  Will no <i>astronomer</i> among your readers direct his attention to this
  subject? Does anything of the kind still linger in the East?</p>

<h3>DISCREPANCIES IN DUGDALE'S ACCOUNT OF SIR RALPH DE COBHAM.</h3>

  <p>There are some difficulties in Dugdale's account of the Cobham family
  which it may be well to bring before your readers; especially as several
  other historians and genealogists have repeated Dugdale's account without
  remarking on its inconsistencies. In speaking of a junior branch of the
  family, he says, in vol. ii. p. 69., "There was also Ralphe de Cobham,
  brother of the first-mentioned Stephen." He only mentions one Stephen but
  names him twice, first at page 66., and again at 69. Perhaps he meant the
  <i>above</i>-mentioned Stephen. He continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"This Ralphe took to wife Mary Countess of Norfolk, widdow of Thomas
  of Brotherton. Which Mary was Daughter to William Lord Ros, and first
  married to William Lord Braose of Brembre; and by her had Issue John, who
  20 E. III., making proof of his age, and doing his Fealty, had Livery of
  his lands."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At page 64. of the same volume he states that Thomas de Brotherton
  died in 12 Edward III., which would be only eight years before his
  widow's son, by a subsequent husband, is said to have become of age. That
  he did become of age in this year we have unquestionable evidence. In
  <i>Cal. Ing. P. Mortem</i>, vol. iv. p. 444., we find this
  entry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Anno 20 Edw. III. Johannes de Cobham, Filius et Hæres Radulphi de
  Cobeham defuncti. Probatio ætatis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is also abundant proof that Thomas de Brotherton died in 12
  Edward III. The most natural way of removing this difficulty would be to
  conclude that John de Cobham was the son of Ralph by a previous marriage.
  But here we have another difficulty to encounter. He is not only called
  the son of Mary, Countess of Norfolk, or Marishall, by Dugdale, but in
  all contemporaneous records. See Rymer's <i>Foed.</i>, vol. vi. p. 136.;
  <i>Rot. Orig.</i>, vol. ii. p. 277.; <i>Cal. Rot. Pat.</i>, p. 178.,
  again at p. 179.; <i>Cal. Ing. P. Mortem</i>, vol. iii. pp. 7. 10. Being
  the son-in-law of the Countess, he was probably called her son to
  distinguish him from a kinsman of the same name, or because of her
  superior rank. She is frequently styled the widow, and sometimes the wife
  of Thomas de Brotherton, even after the death of her subsequent husband,
  Sir Ralph de Cobham. In the escheat at her death she is thus
  described:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Maria Comitissa Norfolc', uxor Thome de Brotherton, Comitis Norfolc',
  Relicta Radi de Cobeham, Militis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is remarkable that this discrepancy in Sir John Cobham's age, and
  the time of his supposed mother's marriage with his father, has never
  before, as far as my knowledge extends, been noticed by any of the
  numerous writers who have repeated Dugdale's account of this family.</p>

  <p>Before concluding I will mention another mistake respecting the
  Countess which runs through most of our county histories where she is
  named. For a short period she became an inmate of the Abbey of Langley,
  and is generally stated to have entered it previously to her marriage
  with Sir Ralph de Cobham. Clutterbuck, in his <i>History of
  Hertfordshire</i> (vol. ii. p. 512.), for instance, relates the
  circumstance in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In the 19th year of the reign of Edward III., she became a nun in the
  Abbey of Langley, in the country of Norfolk; but quitting that religious
  establishment, she married Sir Ralph Cobham, Knt., and died anno 36
  Edward III."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By <i>Cal. Ing. P. Mortem</i>, vol. i. p. 328., we find that Ralph
  Cobham died 19th Edward III.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, that is, the same year in which the
  Countess entered the Abbey, from whence we may conclude that she retired
  there to pass in seclusion the period of mourning.</p>

  <p>If my copy be correct, it is 19 Edw. II. in the printed calendar: but
  it must have been Edw. III., for, from the possessions described, it must
  have been Sir Ralph Cobham who married the widow of Thomas de
  Brotherton.</p>

<h3>HENRY CHETTLE.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Rimbault, in the introduction to his edition of <i>Kind-Hearts'
  Dream</i>, for the Percy Society, says, "Of the author, Henry Chettle,
  very little is known: ... we are ignorant of the time and place of his
  birth or death, and of the manner in which he obtained his living." (Pp.
  vii. viii.) I trouble you with this note in the hope that it may furnish
  him with a clue to further particulars of Henry Chettle.</p>

  <p>Hutchins (<i>Hist. of Dorset.</i>, vol. i. p. 53. ed. 1774) mentions a
  family named Chettle, which was seated at Blandford St. Mary from 1547 to
  about 1690, and gives the following names as lineal successors to
  property in that parish: Henry Chettle, ob. 1553. John, s. and h., ob.
  1590. Edward, s. and h., ob. 1609, "leaving Henry, his son and heir,
  eleven years nine months old." Among the burials for the same parish (p.
  57.) occurs "Henry Chettle, Esq., 1616;" and at pp. 119. 208. the
  marriage of "Henry Chettle, Gent., and Susan Chaldecot, 1610." This last
  extract is from the register of the parish of Steple, in the Isle of
  Purbeck, which also contains, says Hutchins, many notices of the Chettle
  family; but all, I should infer, <i>subsequent</i> to the year 1610.</p>

  <p>I have ascertained that the statement in Hutchins corresponds with the
  entry in the register of Blandford St. Mary, of the burial of Henry
  Chettle in 1616; and that there is <i>no</i> entry of the baptism of any
  one of that name. In fact, the registers only begin in 1581. Now it is
  clear that there were two persons of this name living at the same time,
  viz. H.C., aged eleven years in 1609; and H.C., who marries in 1610. And
  if the conjecture of the learned editor be correct, as probably it is,
  that the poet, Henry Chettle, "died in or before the year 1607," it is
  equally clear that he was a <i>third</i> of the same name, and that he
  could not be the person whose name occurs as buried in 1616. But the name
  is not a common one, and there seems sufficient to warrant further
  research into this subject. I venture, therefore, to make these two
  suggestions in the form of Queries:</p>

  <p>I. Can any <i>internal</i> evidence be gathered from the writings of
  Henry Chettle, as to his family, origin, and birthplace? <i>Kind-Heart's
  Dream</i>, the only one of his works which I have either seen or have the
  means of consulting, contains nothing specific enough to connect him with
  Dorset, or the West. It would seem, indeed, as if he were acquainted with
  the New Forest, but not better than with Essex, and other parts adjacent
  to London.</p>

  <p>II. Would it not be worth while to search the Heralds' Visitations for
  the county of Dorset, the Will-office, and the Inquisitions "post
  mortem?" The family was of some consequence, and is mentioned even in
  Domesday-book as holding lands in the county. Hutchins blazons their
  arms&mdash;Az. 3 spiders, or; but gives no pedigree of the family.</p>

<h3>COVERDALE'S BIBLE.</h3>

  <p>We are told by Mr. Granville Penn, in the Preface to the
  <i>Annotations to the Book of the New Covenant</i>, that "in 1535
  Coverdale printed an English translation of the Old Testament, to which
  he annexed Tyndale's revision of the New, probably revised by himself.
  These last constitute what is called <i>Coverdale's Bible</i>. Now, the
  title-page of Coverdale's Bible expressly states that it was faithfully
  and truly translated out of Douche and Latyn into Englishe;" and that
  this is literally true may be seen by comparing any portion of it with
  the common German version of Luther. The following portion is taken quite
  at hazard from the original edition; and I have added Tyndale's version
  of 1526, as edited by Mr. Offor:</p>

  sayde vnto them: Murmur not amonge youre selues. No man can come vnto me,
  excepte the father which hath sent me, drawe him. And I shal rayse him vp
  at the last daye. It is wrytten in the prophetes: They shal all be
  taughte of God. Who so euer now heareth it of the father and lerneth it,
  commeth vnto me. Not that eny man hath sene the father, saue he which is

<h3>FOLK LORE OF LANCASHIRE. NO. 1.</h3>

  <p>Lancashire, like all other counties, has its own peculiar
  superstitions, manners, and customs, which find no parallels in those of
  other localities. It has also, no doubt, many local observances, current
  opinions, old proverbs, and vulgar ditties, which are held and known in
  common with the inhabitants of a greater extent of county, and differ
  merely in minor particulars;&mdash;the necessary result of imperfect oral
  transmission. In former numbers of this work a few isolated specimens of
  the folk-lore of this district have been noticed, and the present attempt
  is to give permanency to a few others.</p>

  <p>1. If a person's hair, when thrown into the fire, burns brightly, it
  is a sure sign that the individual will live long. The brighter the flame
  the longer life, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>2. A young person frequently stirs the fire with the poker to test the
  humour of a lover. If the fire blaze brightly, the lover is
  <i>good-humoured</i>; and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

  <p>3. A crooked sixpence, or a copper coin with a hole through, are
  accounted <i>lucky</i> coins.</p>

  <p>4. Cutting or paring the nails of the hands or feet on a Friday or
  Sunday, is very unlucky.</p>

  <p>5. If a person's <i>left</i> ear burn, or feel hot, somebody is
  <i>praising</i> the party; if the <i>right</i> ear burn, then it is a
  sure sign that some one is speaking evil of the person.</p>

  <p>6. Children are frequently cautioned by their parents not to walk
  <i>backwards</i> when going an errand; it is a sure sign that they will
  be unfortunate in their objects.</p>

  <p>7. Witchcraft, and the belief in its reality, is not yet exploded in
  many of the rural districts. The writer is acquainted with parties who
  place full credence in persons possessing the power to bewitch cows,
  sheep, horses, and even those persons to whom the witch has an antipathy.
  One respectable farmer assured me that his horse was <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span> <i>bewitched
  into the stable through a loophole twelve inches by three</i>; the
  <i>fact</i> he said was beyond doubt, for he had locked the stable-door
  himself when the horse was in the field, and had kept the key in his
  pocket. Soon after this, however, a party of farmers went through a
  process known by the name of "<i>burning the witch out</i>," or
  "<i>killing the witch</i>," as some express it; the person suspected soon
  died, and the neighbourhood became free from his evil doings.</p>

  <p>8. A horse-shoe is still nailed behind many doors to counteract the
  effects of witchcraft: a <i>hagstone</i> with a hole through, tied to the
  key of the stable-door, protects the horses, and, if hung up at the bed's
  head, the farmer also.</p>

  <p>9. A hot iron put into the cream during the process of churning,
  expels the witch from the churn; and dough in preparation for the baker
  is protected by being marked with the figure of a cross.</p>

  <p>10. Warts are cured by being rubbed over with a black snail, but the
  snail must afterwards be impaled upon a hawthorn. If a bag containing as
  many small pebbles as a person has warts, be tossed over the <i>left</i>
  shoulder, it will transfer the warts to whoever is unfortunate enough to
  pick up the bag.</p>

  <p>11. If black snails are seized by the horn and tossed over the
  <i>left</i> shoulder, the process will insure <i>good luck</i> to the
  person who performs it.</p>

  <p>12. Profuse bleeding is said to be instantly stopped by certain
  persons who pretend to possess the secret of a certain form of words
  which immediately act as a charm.</p>

  <p>13. The power of bewitching, producing evil to parties by
  <i>wishing</i> it, &amp;c., is supposed to be transmitted from one
  possessor to another when one of the parties is about to die. The writer
  is in possession of full particulars respecting this supposed
  transfer.</p>

  <p>14. Cramp is effectually prevented by placing the shoes with the
  <i>toes</i> just peeping from beneath the coverlet; the same is also
  prevented by tying the garter round the <i>left</i> leg <i>below</i> the
  knee.</p>

  <p>15. Charmed rings are worn by many for the cure of dyspepsia; and so
  also are charmed belts for the cure of rheumatism.</p>

  <p>16. A <i>red-haired</i> person is supposed to bring in ill-luck if he
  be the first to enter a house on New Year's Day. <i>Black-haired</i>
  persons are rewarded with liquor and small gratuities for "taking in the
  new year" to the principal houses in their respective neighbourhoods.</p>

  <p>17. If any householder's fire does not burn <i>through</i> the night
  of New Year's Eve, it betokens bad luck during the ensuing year; and if
  any party allow another a live coal, or even a lighted candle, on such an
  occasion, the bad luck is extended to the other part for commiserating
  with the former in his misfortunes.</p>

  <p>Many other specimens of the folk lore of this district might be
  enumerated; but since many here have implicit faith in Lover's
  expression,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There is luck in <i>odd</i> numbers;"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I will reserve them for a future opportunity, considering that
  <i>seventeen</i> paragraphs are sufficient to satisfy all except the most
  thorough-paced <i>folklorians</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Proclamation of Langholme Fair.</i>&mdash;In an old paper I find
  the following proclamation of a fair, to be held in a town in Scotland;
  it may, perhaps, amuse some of your numerous readers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"O yes! and that's a time. O yes! and that's twa times. O yes! and
  that's the third and last time: All manner of pearson or pearsons
  whatsoever let 'em draw near, and I shall let you ken that there is a
  fair to be held at the muckle town of Langholme, for the space of aught
  days; wherein if any hustrin, custrin, land-louper, dukes-couper, or
  gang-y-gate swinger, shall breed any urdam, durdam, brabblement, or
  squabblement, he shall have his lugs tacked to the muckle trone, with a
  nail of twal-a-penny, until he down of his hobshanks and up with his
  mucle doubs, and pray to heaven neen times, Gold bles the king, and
  thrice the muckle Lord of Relton, pay a groat to me Jammey Ferguson,
  bailiff of the aforesaid manor. So ye heard my proclamation, and I'll

  <p><i>Seats in Churches.</i>&mdash;The following curious notice of seats

  by him from <i>Whitaker's Whalley</i>, 2nd edit. 4to. p. 228.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"My man Shuttleworth, of Harking, made this form and here will I sit
  when I come; and any cousin Nowell may make one behind me, if he please,
  and my son Sherburne shall make one on the other side; and Mr. Catteral
  another behind him; and for the residue the use shall be, <i>first come
  first speed; and that will make the proud wives of Whalley rise betimes
  to come to church</i>."</p>

  <i>History of Edward II.</i>, by E.F., written A.D. 1627 (see "NOTES AND
  QUERIES" Vol. i., pp. 91. 220.), folio edition, p. 113., I find "The
  Queen (Isabella) who had already a French and an Italian trick, was
  jealous lest she should here taste a Flemish one;" because she feared
  lest the Earl of Henault should abandon her cause. This instance is, I
  think, earlier than any yet referred to.</p>

  <p><i>Use of Monosyllables.</i>&mdash;The most remarkable instance of the

      <p>I never lov'd a tree or flow'r</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This passage contains 126 words, 110 of which are monosyllables, and
  the remainder words of only two syllables. The sentiment embodied
  throughout is that of violent mental emotion; and it affords a further
  illustration of the correctness of MR. C. FORBES'S theory (Vol. i., p.
  228.) that "the language of passion is almost invariably broken and
  abrupt."</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>THE TALE OF THE WARDSTAFF.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your antiquarian correspondents furnish further elucidation
  of the strange ceremony of the gathering of the Wardstaff (which was in
  old time one of the customs of the hundred of Ongar, in Essex) than are
  to be found in Morant's <i>History of Essex</i>, vol. i. p. 126.? from
  whence it was incorrectly copied in Blount's <i>Jocular Tenures</i> by
  Beckwith, 4to. ed. It has been also more correctly given by Sir Francis
  Palgrave, in his <i>Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth</i>,
  Part II. p. clvii., who justly styles it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"a strange and uncouth fragment of the earliest customs of the
  Teutons; in which we can still recognise <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span> the tone and the
  phraseology of the Courts of the Eresburg. The <i>Irminsule</i> itself
  having been described as a trunk of a tree, Thor was worshipped under the
  same rude symbol; and it may be suspected that the singular respect and
  reverence shown to the ward-staff of the East Saxons is not without its
  relation to the rites and ceremonies of the heathen time, though
  innocently and unconsciously retained."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the time of publication of his learned and interesting work, Sir
  Francis did me the honour to adopt some conjectural corrections of
  Morant's very corrupt transcript of the rhyme, which I furnished at his
  request, in common with others suggested by the late Mr. Price. Since
  that time, a more mature examination of it has enabled me, I think, to
  put it into a form much more nearly resembling what it must have
  originally been; many of the corrections being obviously required by the
  prose details which accompany it in the MS. from which Morant gave it. It
  may not, therefore, be unacceptable to some of your readers, to subjoin
  this corrected copy. It may be proper to premise, that "The <i>Tale</i>
  of the Wardstaff" is the <i>tallying</i> or <i>cutting</i> of it, and
  that it was evidently originally spoken in parts, assigned as under;
  although it should seem that there is no indication of this arrangement
  in the MS.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It will be at once apparent that this is a corrupt transcript of a
  semi-Saxon original of much earlier date; and by comparing it with
  Morant's very blundering copy, the conjectural corrections I have essayed
  will be perceived to be numerous. Many of then will, however, be found
  not only warranted, but absolutely necessary, from the accompanying prose
  account of the ceremony. The MS. from which it was taken by Morant, was
  an account of the Rents of the hundred of Ongar, in the time of John
  Stonar of Loughton, who had a grant of it for his life in the 34th year
  of King Henry VIII. He seems to have died 12th June, 1566, holding of the
  Queen, by the twentieth part of a knight's fee, and the yearly rent of
  13<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, the manor, park, chase, &amp;c., of
  Hatfield Broad Oak, with the hundreds of Ongar and Harlow; and the
  <i>Wardstaff</i> of the same hundreds, then valued at 101<i>l.</i>
  15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> As the <i>Wardstaff</i> is said by Morant to make
  a considerable figure in old records, it is reasonable to hope that a
  more satisfactory account of it may still lie amongst unsunned ancient
  muniments. All the old Teutonic judicial assemblies were, as Sir F.
  Palgrave remarks, held in the open air, beneath the sky and <i>by the
  light of the sun</i>. The following is a part of the ancient rhyme by
  which the proceedings of the famous Vehm-Gerichte were opened, which were
  first printed by Schottelius, and the whole of which may be found in
  Beck's <i>Geschichte der Westphalischen Fehm-Gerichte</i>, and in Sir F.
  Palgrave's work. The similarity of expression is remarkable.</p>

  <p>I must refer to Morant, to Beckwith or Sir F. Palgrave, for the
  details of the ceremony of the Wardstaff, which it should appear was
  observed at least as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but in
  Morant's time it had long been neglected. In the hope that some of your
  antiquarian correspondents may be enabled to throw more light on this
  very curious custom, I will merely add, that Morant suggests that it is
  possible some elucidation of it might be found "in the Evidence House in
  Hatfield Church, where (he says) are a great number of writings relating
  to the priory and lordship."</p>

<h3>BALLAD ASCRIBED TO SIR C. HANBURY WILLIAMS.</h3>

  <p>Being engaged on a collection of fugitive pieces by wits of the last
  century, yet unprinted, I wish to take the opinion of your valuable
  correspondents as to the authorship of the enclosed piece. It has been
  pointed out to me in an album, dated at the beginning Feb. 14th, 1743; it
  occurs towards the end of the volume (which is nearly filled), without
  date, and signed C.H. Williams.</p>

  <p>It is evidently not autograph, being in the hand which mainly pervades
  the book. Had Sir C.H. Williams been a baronet at the time, his title
  would doubtless have been attached to his name. I wish to know, first, at
  what date Sir C.H. Williams was born, became a baronet, and died?
  Secondly, is there any internal evidence of style that the ballad is by
  his hand? Thirdly, is there any clue as to who the fair and cruel Lucy
  may have been? And lastly, whether any of your correspondents have seen
  the thing in print before?</p>

<h3>MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Book called Tartuare.&mdash;William Wallace in London.</i>&mdash;1.
  Is there any one of your correspondents, learned or unlearned, who can
  oblige me with any account of a printed book called <i>Tartuare?</i> Its
  date would be early in the sixteenth century, if not before this.</p>

  <p>2. After William Wallace had been surprised and taken, he was brought
  to London, and lodged, it is said, in a part of what is now known as
  Fenchurch Street. There is a reader and correspondent of yours, who, I am
  assured, can point out the site of this house, or whatever it was. Will
  he kindly assist archæological inquirers, by informing us whereabouts it
  stood?</p>

  <p class="author">W.(I.)</p>

  <p><i>Obeism.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers give me some information
  about <i>obeism</i>? I am anxious to know whether it is in itself a
  religion, or merely a rite practised in some religion in Africa, and
  imported thence to the West Indies (where, I am told, it is rapidly
  gaining ground again); and whether the <i>obeist</i> obtains the immense
  power he is said to possess over his brother negroes by any acquired art,
  or simply by working upon the more superstitious <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span> minds of his companions.
  Any information, however, on the subject will be acceptable.</p>

  <p><i>Aged Monks.</i>&mdash;Ingulphus (<i>apud Wharton, Anglia Sacra</i>,
  613.) speaks of five monks of Croyland Abbey, who lived in the tenth
  century, the oldest of whom, he says, attained the age of one hundred and
  sixty-eight years: his name was Clarembaldus. The youngest, named
  Thurgar, died at the premature age of one hundred and fifteen. Can any of
  your correspondents inform me of any similar instance of longevity being
  recorded in monkish chronicles? I remember reading of some old English
  monks who died at a greater age than brother Thurgar, but omitted to
  "make a note of it" at the time, and should now be glad to find it.</p>

  <p><i>Lady Alice Carmichael, daughter of John first Earl of

  in 1672. He was born 28th February, 1638, and married, 9th October, 1669,
  Beatrice Drummond, second daughter of David third Lord Maderty, by whom
  he had seven sons and <i>four</i> daughters. He was created Earl of
  Hyndford in 1701, and died in 1710.</p>

  <p>I wish to be informed (if any of the obliging readers of your valuable
  publication can refer me to the authority) what became of Alice, who is
  named among the daughters of this earl in one of the early Scottish
  Peerages (anterior probably to that of Crawfurd, in 1716), but which the
  writer of this is unable to indicate. Archibald, the youngest son, was
  born 15th April, 1693. The Lady Beatrice, the eldest daughter, married,
  in 1700, <i>Cockburn</i>; Mary married <i>Montgomery</i>; and Anne
  married <i>Maxwell</i>. It is traditionally reported that the Lady Alice,
  in consequence of her marriage with one of her father's tenants, named
  Biset or Bisset, gave offence to the family, who upon that contrived to
  have her name omitted in all subsequent peerages. The late Alexander
  Cassy, of Pentonville, who bequeathed by will several thousand pounds to
  found a charity at Banff, was son of Alexander Cassy of that place, and
  &mdash;&mdash; Biset, one of the daughters, sprung from the above-named

  England), is the Rev. Mr. Fawkes, who (1849) is unmarried. The striking
  accomplishment&mdash;railway travelling and the revolutions of the
  present year&mdash;must be obvious to every one."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My Query to the above is this: Why is the church of Daresbury called
  the White Chapel of England, and how did the name originate? The people
  in the neighbourhood, I understand, know nothing on the subject.</p>

  <p>An answer to the above from one of your learned correspondents would
  greatly oblige.</p>

  <p class="author">J.G.</p>

  <p><i>Ulm Manuscript.</i>&mdash;Can you inform me where the Ulm
  manuscript is, which was in the possession of Archdeacon Butler, at
  Shrewsbury, in the year 1832. It is a document of great interest, and
  some critical value, and ought to be, if it is not already, in public
  keeping. It is a Latin MS. of the Acts and Epistles, probably of the
  ninth century, and contains the Pseudo-Hieronymian Prologue to the
  "Canonical" Epistles.</p>

  <p>It renders the classical passage, 1 John v. 7, 8., in this
  wise:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Quia tres sunt qui testimonium dant, spiritus, et aqua, et sanguis,

  <p>You will remember that it is quoted by Porson in his <i>Letters to
  Travis</i>, p. 148., and again referred to by him, pp. 394. 400.</p>

  <p>Was it sold on the death of the Bishop of Lichfield, or bequeathed to
  any public institution? or did it find its way into the possession of the
  Duke of Sussex, who was curious in biblical matters, and was a
  correspondent of Dr. Butler? Some of your learned readers will perhaps
  enable you to trace it.</p>

  time. It was intended to form three or more Parts. Was it ever completed:
  and if so, where to be procured? In all my searches after books, I never
  met but with this copy.</p>

  <p>At the end of the First Part there is a prospectus of a work Trusler
  intended to publish in the form of a Dictionary (and of which he gives a
  specimen sheet), entitled <i>Sententiæ Variorum</i>. Can any of your Bath

  Knt., Viscount and Baron of Brykbeke in Normandy, who fell at the first
  battle of St. Alban's, in 1455, Chauncy proceeds to state:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"These Entwysels were gentlemen of good account in Lancashire, whose
  mansion-house retains the name of Entwysel, and the last heir of that
  house was one Wilfred Entwysel, who sold his estate, and served as a
  lance at Musselborrow Field, Anno 2 Edw. VI. After that he served the
  Guyes in defence of Meth, and he was one of the four captains of the fort
  of Newhaven, who being infected with the plague and shipped for England,
  landed at Portsmouth, and uncertain of any house, in September, 1549,
  died under a hedge."&mdash;<i>Historical Antiq. of Hertfordshire, by Sir
  Henry Chauncy, Knt., Serj. at Law</i>, p. 472. fol. 1700.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On what authority is this latter statement made, and if it was
  traditional when Chauncy wrote, was the foundation of the tradition good?
  Did Sir Bertin Entwysel leave issue male, and is the precise link
  ascertained which connects him with the family of Entwisle of Entwisle,
  in the parish of Bolton-en-le-Moors, in Lancashire? Wilfred Entwysel was
  not "the last heir of that house," as the <i>post mortem inq.</i> of
  Edmund Entwisle, of Entwisle, Esq., was taken 14 Sept. 1544, and his son
  and heir was George Entwisle, then aged twenty-two years and upwards.

  which details the unsuccessful courtship of Sir Symonds D'Ewes with
  Jemima, afterwards Baroness Crewe, and daughter of Edward Waldgrave,
  Esq., of Lawford House in Essex, and Sarah his wife. It is stated that
  the latter bore the name of Lady Bingham, as being the widow of a knight,
  and that his monument may still be seen in Lawford church. On referring
  to the Suckling Papers, published by Weale, I find no account of this
  monument, though an inscription of that of Edward Waldgrave, Esq.,
  apparently his father-in-law, is given. Can any of your readers give me
  any information as to this lady? I should, if possible, be glad to have
  her maiden name and origin, as well as that of her first husband. She
  might have been the widow of Sir Richard Bingham, Governor of Connaught,
  &amp;c., whose MS. account of the Irish wars is now publishing by the
  Celtic Society, and who died A.D. 1598. In that case, I leave a
  conjecture before me, that she was a Kingsmill of Sidmanton, in
  Hampshire. I mention this to aid enquiry, if any one will be so good as
  to make it. If there is such a monument in existence, his arms may be
  quartered on it, for which I should be also thankful.</p>

  What is still remarkable, the collection remains sole and entire in all
  its pristine originality, as well as simple but substantial bindings,
  uncontaminated by any additions of more modern literature, dressed up in
  gayer suits of calfskin or morocco. It is even said that few of the pages
  of these venerable volumes have even seen the light since the day they
  were deposited there by their first most careful owner, till the present
  proprietor took the liberty of giving them a dusting. How far he has
  advanced in examining their contents is uncertain; but, as he seldom can
  summon courage to withdraw himself from their company, even for his
  parliamentary duties, these literary treasures stand a chance, at last,
  not only of being dusted externally, but of being thoroughly sifted and
  explored internally. A note of the existence of such a collection of
  books is at least worth recording as unique of its kind. I have now a
  query to put in relations to it.</p>

  <p>The collector seems to have been one Hannibal Gamon, whose name
  appears written in fine bold characters,&mdash;as beseems so
  distinguished an appellation,&mdash;on the title-page of each volume;
  but, besides, there is frequently appended this addition&mdash;"<i>tandem
  D.O.M.</i>" The writer has his own solution on the meaning of this bit of
  Latin, but would be glad to know what interpretation any of your readers
  would be inclined to put thereon.</p>

<h3>THE PASSAGE IN TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 386.)</p>

  <p>The oldest edition of this play is the quarto of 1609, in which the
  passage referred to stands thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Hect.</i> Begon, I say, the gods have heard me sweare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>Cas.</i> The gods are deafe to hotte and peevish vowes,</p>
      <p class="i1">They are polluted offrings more abhord,</p>
      <p class="i1">Then spotted livers in the sacrifice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>And.</i> O be perswaded, do not count it holy,</p>
      <p class="i1">It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,</p>
      <p class="i1">But vowes to every purpose must not hold:</p>
      <p class="i1">Unarme, sweet Hector."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This reading, by stopping the sense at "holy," renders less likely to
  be correct the emendation of Tyrwhitt, adopted by Malone:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"O be persuaded: do not count it holy</p>
      <p>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,</p>
      <p>For we would give much to use violent thefts,</p>
      <p>And rob in the behalf of charity."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Dr. Johnson observes, "This is so oddly confused in the folio, that I
  transcribe it as a specimen of incorrectness:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">'&mdash;&mdash;do not count it holy</p>
      <p>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful</p>
      <p>For we would count give much to as violent thefts,' &amp;c."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With reference to these particulars, I should be glad if you would
  allow me to propose a reading which has not yet been
  suggested:&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"O be persuaded; do not count it holy:</p>
      <p>To hurt, by being just, count it unlawful:</p>
      <p>For we would give, as much, to violent thefts,</p>
      <p>And rob, in the behalf of charity."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The meaning being, it is as unlawful to do hurt by being just, as it
  would be to <i>give</i> to a robbery, or to <i>rob</i> for a charity; to
  assist a bad cause by a good deed, or a good cause by a bad deed.</p>

  <p>The word "count," in its second occurrence, was inserted by the
  printer in the wrong line; when it is restored to its proper place, the
  passage presents but little difficulty.</p>

<h3>BLACK IMAGES OF THE VIRGIN.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 510.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent, MR. HOLT WHITE, throws cut a suggestion relative
  to the origin of the black doll as a sign at old store shops, which is
  ingenious, but not very probable. The images of black virgins are
  confined, I believe, to the south of Europe, with the exception of the
  celebrated shrine of Einsiedeln in Switzerland. The origin of the colour
  appears to be oriental, as MR. W. surmises. I send the following extract,
  in answer to his query on the subject. It is a quotation from Grimm, in
  M. Michelet's <i>Introduction to Universal History</i>; and, as your
  readers must be all familiar with the language of the gifted historian, I
  will not make the attempt to convey his brilliant style into another
  tongue.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Une des idées qui reviennent le plus dans nos meistersinger, dit
  Grimm, c'est la comparaison de l'incarnation de Jésus Christ avec
  <i>l'aurore d'un nouveau soleil</i>. Toute religion avait eu son
  soleil-dieu, et dès le quatrième siècle l'église occidentale célèbre la
  naissance du Christ au jour où le soleil remonte, au 25 Décembre,
  c'est-à-dire, au jour où l'on célébrait la naissance du <i>soleil
  invincible</i>. C'est un rapport évident avec le soleil-dieu Mithra. On
  lit encore, dans nos poètes, que Jésus à sa naissance reposait sur le
  sein de Marie, comme un oiseau, qui, le soir, se réfugie dans une fleur
  de <i>nuit</i> éclose au milieu de la mer. Quel rapport rémarquable avec
  le mythe de la naissance de Brama, enfermé dans le lis des eaux, le
  lotus, jusqu'au jour où la fleur fut ouverte par les rayons du soleil,
  c'est-à-dire, par Vischnou lui-même, qui avait produit cette fleur. Le
  Christ, le Nouveau-jour, est né de la nuit, c'est-à-dire de Marie la
  <i>Noire</i>, dont les pied reposent sur la lune, et dont la tête est
  couronnée de planètes comme d'un brillant diadême. (Voyez les tableaux
  d'Albert Dürer.) Ainsi reparaît, comme dans l'ancien culte, cette grande
  divinité, appelée tour-à-tour Maïa, Bhawani, Isis, Cérès, Proserpine,
  Perséphone. Reine du ciel, elle est la nuit d'où sort la vie, et où toute
  vie se replonge; mystérieuse réunion de la vie et de la mort. Elle
  s'appelle aussi la rosée, et dans les mythes allemands, la rosée est
  considérée comme le principe qui reproduit et redonne la vie. Elle n'est
  pas seulement la nuit, mais comme mère du soleil, elle est aussi l'aurore
  devant qui les planètes brillent et s'empressent, comme pour Perséphone.
  Lorsqu'elle signifie la terre, comme Cérès, elle est représentée avec la
  gerbe de blé; elle est Perséphone, la graine de semence; comme cette
  déesse, elle a sa faucille: c'est la demi-lune qui repose sous ses pieds.
  Enfin, comme la déesse d'Ephèse, la triste Cérès et Proserpine, elle est
  belle et brillante, et cependant sombre et noire, selon l'expression du
  Cantique des Cantiques: 'Je suis noir, mais pleine de charmes, le soleil
  m'a brûlée' (le Christ). Encore aujourd'hui, l'image de la mère de Dieu
  est noire à Naples, comme à Einsiedeln en Suisse. Elle unit ainsi le jour
  et la nuit, la joie avec la tristesse, le soleil et la lune (chaleur,
  humidité), le terrestre et le céleste."</p>

  <p>This fragment is, perhaps, rather too long; but I think your readers
  will consider it too beautiful to abridge. The late G. Higgins, in his
  <i>Anacalepsis</i> (ii. 100.), has some observations to the same purport,
  and points out the resemblance of some of the old Italian paintings of
  the Virgin and Child to Egyptian representations of Isis and the infant
  Horus.</p>

  <p>Many of these ideas have been taken up by the free-masons, and are
  typified and symbolised in their initiatory ceremonies.</p>

<h3>OUTLINE IN PAINTING.</h3>

  <p>A correspondent (J.O.W.H.) at p. 318. of Vol. i. asks a question on
  the subject of outline in painting; instancing the works of Albert Durer
  and Raffaelle as examples of defined, and those of Titian, Murillo,
  &amp;c., of indefined outline. He wishes to know whether there is "a
  right and a wrong in the matter, apart from anything which men call
  taste?"</p>

  <p>The subject generally is a curious one, and has interested me for some
  time; as experiments exhibit several singular phenomena resulting from
  the interference and diffraction of rays of light in passing by the
  outline of a material body. As a matter of fact, I believe I may say,
  that there is no such thing in nature as a perfectly defined outline;
  since the diffraction of the rays, in passing it, causes them to be
  projected upon it more or less, according to the nature of the particular
  body, and the intensity of the light. And I may remark, by the way, that
  I believe this circumstance of the projection of a star upon the moon's
  disc at the time of an occultation, is to be accounted for on this
  principle (though with all due deference to higher authority); a
  phenomenon which is to this day unexplained.</p>

  <p>Of course every outline is rendered less defined by any motion of the
  eye of the observer, however slight. Hence, perhaps, the comparative
  indistinctness of outline commonly seen in pictures, compared with those
  in nature; as the artist <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page64"></a>{64}</span> would be apt to take advantage of this
  circumstance, and give to his painting the same kind of effect the
  reality would have to an eye wandering over it; thereby taking away the
  attention from individual parts, and, as it were, forcing it to judge of
  the general effect, which general effect is, perhaps, the main object in
  painting.</p>

  <p>Hence it follows that wherever, in any design, separate portions are
  intended to arrest attention, the outline should be more defined and,
  accordingly, we may remark that Albert Durer, and others like him, who
  were very careful of minutiæ, are also distinct and hard in their
  outlines, which is also the case, for the most part, in the Dutch school,
  and in architectural paintings, fruit-pieces, &amp;c.; and we find that
  in proportion as the artist discards the comparatively unworthy minute
  accompaniments of his subject, and aims at unity of effect, so does he
  neglect sharpness of outline. Which is the <i>correct</i>
  practice&mdash;distinctness, or indistinctness of outline&mdash;will be
  differently judged by those who hold different opinions on painting in
  general. While one person will maintain that a picture, to be perfect,
  must be an exact copy of nature, in short an artistic daguerreotype;
  another will hold almost the contrary; so that the subject of outline
  must be matter of opinion still. However, the lover of general effect has
  this rational ground of argument on his side, viz., there is no such
  thing as a strictly defined outline in nature, even to an eye at rest;
  while to one in motion, which is perhaps the normal state, that outline
  is rendered still more indistinct.</p>

<h3>TEN CHILDREN AT A BIRTH.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 459.)</p>

  <p>The curiosity excited by the perusal of my previous communication
  under the foregoing head, and the interesting editorial note appended in
  "NOTES AND QUERIES," induce me to continue the attempt to verify one of
  the most remarkable instances of abnormal fecundity in an individual of
  the human species recorded in modern times. The reader must judge of the
  following "circumstantial evidence:"&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. I have just seen widow Platts (formerly Sarah Birch), a poor, fat,
  decent woman, who keeps a small greengrocer's shop, in West Bar,
  Sheffield. She says she was born in Spring Street in the same town, on
  the 29th Sept. 1781; well remembers wondering why she was so much looked
  at when a girl: and her surprise, when afterwards told by her mother,
  that she was one of ten children born at the same time. Had often been
  told that she was so small at birth, that she was readily put into a
  quart measure; and for some time, lay in a basket before the fire
  "wrapped in a flannel like a newly hatched chicken."</p>

  <p>2. The improbability of finding any living gossip who was present at
  the birth, must be obvious: but I have conversed with old women who had
  heard their mothers describe the occurrence from personal knowledge.</p>

  <p>3. One ancient dame had no more doubt of the fact than the cause of
  it. Having apparently heard and believed a monstrous tradition of a
  multitudinous gestation extant in common "folklore." "It was," said she,
  with all gravity, "the effect of a wish," intended to spite the father;
  who, having had two children by his wife, and an interval of <i>nine
  years</i> elapsing before the portentous pregnancy in question, did not
  desire, it seems, any further increase to his family.</p>

  <p>4. The parents died, the daughter married, and the "story of her
  birth" was forgotten: until the publication of White's <i>Sheffield
  Directory</i> in 1833, when, among other local memorabilia, the strange
  announcement of "ten children at birth," was reproduced on the
  contemporary authority of the <i>Leeds Mercury</i>. From that time Mrs.
  Platts has been more or less an object of curiosity.</p>

  <p>5. The <i>Directory</i> paragraph is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"An instance of <i>extraordinary fecundity</i> is recorded in the
  <i>Leeds Mercury</i> of 1781, which says that <i>Ann</i> [Sarah]
  <i>Birch</i>, of Sheffield, was, in that year, <i>delivered of ten
  children!!!</i> We, in our time, have heard of Sheffield ladies having
  three children at birth; but we know no other case, but that of the
  aforesaid Mrs. Birch, which countenances the fructiferous fame which they
  have obtained in some circles."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have been unsuccessful in an effort to collate the foregoing with
  the original newspaper paragraph: but Mr. White, while he personally
  assured me of the veracity of the transcript, also pointed out to me an
  earlier version of the same fact from the same source in the <i>Annals of
  the Clothing Districts</i>, published about thirty years since.</p>

  <p>6. In conformity with the suggestion (NOTES AND QUERIES, Vol. ii., p.
  459), I have examined the Parish Register of Baptisms, but the entry is
  as curt and formal as possible, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Sarah, Dr. of Thos. and Sarah Birch, Cutler,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>under the date, Dec. 12.1781.</p>

  <p>Taking all the foregoing circumstances into account, there seems to me
  little ground for the erection of any strong objection to the alleged
  fact&mdash;extraordinary as it is&mdash;of ten children having been
  brought forth at one time; or, to the hardly less interesting
  coincidence, that one of them is still living. I cannot but add, that if
  the contemporary notice of this extraordinary birth in the <i>Leeds
  Mercury</i> of 1781 should not be admitted as good evidence for the fact,
  it does, at least, negative the presumptive value of any objection <!--
  Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span> derived
  from the silence of the writer in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
  six years afterwards; strange as such silence assuredly appears. After
  all, the question occurs: What has become of the bodies said to have been
  preserved? As all parties concur in naming "old Mr. Staniforth" as the
  accoucheur in attendance on Mrs. Birch; and as that gentleman has been
  dead many years, I called upon his eldest surviving pupil, Mr. Nicholson,
  surgeon, to ask him whether, in conversation, or among the preparations
  in the surgery of his worthy master, he had ever met with any
  illustration of the parturition in question? He replied that he had not.
  It may not, perhaps, be out of place here to mention that the above-named
  Mr. Nicholson, surgeon, himself delivered a poor woman of five children,
  on the 10th of February, 1829, at Handsworth Woodhouse, near Sheffield.
  This case was even more remarkable than that which gave occasion to the
  paper which was read before the Royal Society in 1787, inasmuch as not
  only were four of the children born alive, but three of them lived to be
  baptized.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S USE OF "CAPTIOUS."</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 354.)</p>

  <p>In <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>, Act I. Sc. 3., Helena says to the
  Countess, speaking of her love for Bertram,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"I know I love in vain; strive against hope;</p>
      <p>Yet, in this captious and intenible sieve,</p>
      <p>I still pour in the waters of my love,</p>
      <p>And lack not to lose still."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is not without hesitation that I venture to oppose MR. SINGER on a
  point on which he is so well entitled to give an opinion. But I cannot
  help thinking that MR. SINGER'S explanation, besides being somewhat too
  refined and recondite, is less applicable to the general sense and drift
  of the passage than that of Steevens, which Malone and Mr. Collier have
  adopted.</p>

  <p>What I think wanting to Steevens' interpretation, is an increase, if I
  may so express myself, of intensity. He takes the word, I conceive, in
  its right bearing, but does not give it all the requisite force. I should
  suggest that it means not merely "<i>recipient</i>, capable of
  receiving," but, to coin a word, <i>captatious</i>, eager or greedy to
  receive, absorbing; as we say <i>avidum mare</i>, or a <i>greedy
  gulf</i>. The Latin analogous to it in this sense would be, not
  <i>capax</i>, or MR. SINGER'S <i>captiosus</i>, but <i>captax</i>, or
  <i>captabundus</i>; neither of which words, however, occurs.</p>

  <p>The sense of the word, like that of many others in the same author,
  must be determined by the scope and object of the passage in which it is
  used. The object of Helena, in declaring her love to the Countess, is to
  show the all-absorbing nature of it; to prove that she is <i>tota in
  illo</i>; and that, however she may strive to stop the cravings of it,
  her endeavours are of no more use than the attempt to fill up a
  bottomless abyss.</p>

  <p>The reader may, if he pleases, compare her case with that of other
  heroines in like predicaments. Thus Medæa, in <i>Apollonius
  Rhodius</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p><span lang="el" title="'Pantê moi phrenes eisin amêchanoi, oude tis alkê Pêmatos.'"
  >"&#x3A0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B7; &#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;

  &#x3A0;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;."</span></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And the same lady in <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"&mdash;&mdash; Luctata diu, postquam ratione furorem,</p>
      <p>Vincere non poterat. Frustra, Medea, repugnas.</p>
      <p class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
      <p>Excute virgineo conceptas pectore flammas,</p>
      <p>Si potes, infelix. Si possem sanior essem:</p>
      <p>Sed trahit invitam nova vis."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Or Dido, in <i>Virgil</i> or <i>Ovid</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Ille quidem malè gratus, et ad munera surdus;</p>
      <p class="i1">Et quo si non sim stulta carere velim:</p>
      <p>Non tamen Æneam, quamvis male cogitat, odi;</p>
      <p class="i1">Sed queror infidum, questaque pejus amo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Or Phædra, in <i>Seneca</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;"Furor cogit sequi</p>
      <p>Pejora: vadit animus in præceps sciens,</p>
      <p>Remeatque, frustra sana consilia appetens.</p>
      <p>Sic cum gravatam navita adversâ ratem</p>
      <p>Propellit undâ, cedit in vanum labor,</p>
      <p>Et victa prono puppis aufertur vado."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The complaints of all are alike; they lament that they make attempts
  to resist their passion, but find it not to be resisted; that they are
  obliged at last to yield themselves entirely to it, and to feel their
  whole thoughts, as it were, swallowed up by it.</p>

  <p>Such being the way in which Shakspeare represents Helena, and such the
  sentiments which he puts into her mouth, it seems evident that the
  interpretation of <i>captious</i> in the sense of <i>absorbent</i> is
  better adapted to the passage than the explanation of it in the sense of
  <i>fallacious</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I know I love in vain, and strive against hope; yet into this
  <i>insatiable</i> and <i>unretaining</i> sieve I still pour in the waters
  of my love, and fail not to lose still."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I said that the sense of <i>fallacious</i> seemed to be too refined
  and recondite. To believe that Shakspeare borrowed his <i>captious</i> in
  this sense, from the Latin <i>captiosus</i>, we must suppose that he was
  well acquainted with the exact sense of the Latin word; a supposition
  which, in regard to a man who had <i>small Latin</i>, we can scarcely be
  justified in entertaining. This interpretation is, therefore, too
  recondite: and to imagine Helena as applying the word to Bertram as being
  "<i>incapable of receiving</i> her love," and "truly <i>captious</i>" (or
  deceitful and ensnaring) "in that respect," is surely to indulge in too
  much refinement of exposition.</p>

  <p>That Shakspeare had in his mind, as MR. SINGER <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span> suggests, the punishment
  of the Danaides, is extremely probable; but this only makes the
  explanation of <i>captious</i> in the sense of <i>absorbent</i> more
  applicable to the passage, with which that of Seneca, quoted above, may
  be aptly compared.</p>

  <p>I am sorry that Johnson was so unfortunate as to propose
  <i>carious</i> as an emendation; but even in doing this, he had,
  according to my notion of the lines, the right sense in view, viz., that
  of <i>letting through</i> or <i>swallowing up</i>, like a rotten tub or a
  quicksand.</p>

  <p>I hope that MR. SINGER will take these remarks in good part, as being
  offered, not from a wish to oppose his opinion, but from a conviction
  that the interpretation now given is right, and from a desire that to
  every word in Shakspeare should be assigned its true signification.</p>

<h3>SWORD OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. iii., p. 24.)</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that the sword respecting which P. inquires
  is in the armoury at Goodrich Court. It was presented by Lord Viscount
  Gage to the late Sir Samuel Meyrick, and exhibited by Dr. Meyrick to the
  Society of Antiquaries, Nov. 23. 1826. The Doctor's letter is to be found
  in the Appendix to the <i>Archæologia</i> of that date, with an engraving
  of the sword. He states that the arms on the pommel are those of Battle
  Abbey, that its date is about A.D. 1430, and that it was the symbol of
  the criminal jurisdiction of the abbot. At the dissolution of the abbey
  it fell into the hands of Sir John Gage, who was one of the commissioners
  for taking the surrender of religious houses.</p>

  <p>Its entire length is 3 feet 5 inches, and the breadth of the blade at
  the guard 2 inches. The Doctor considers it to be "the oldest perfect
  sword in England." The arms are a cross, with a crown in the first and
  last quarters, and a sword in the second and third. There are also the
  letters T.L., the initials of the Abbot, Thomas de Lodelow, who held that
  office from 1417 to 1437. This fixes its date in the reign of Henry V.,
  though the fact of the first William having been the founder of Battle
  Abbey has given colour to the tradition of its having been his
  property.</p>

  <p>I much doubt the fact of the Conqueror's sword ever having been in the
  possession of the monks of Battle. Nor am I aware of any writer
  contemporary with the dissolution of that famous abbey who asserts it.
  William's royal robe, adorned with precious gems, and a feretory in the
  form of an altar, inclosing 300 relics of the saints, were bequeathed by
  him to the monastery; and Rufus transmitted them to Battle, where they
  were duly received on the 8th of the calends of November, 1088. This
  information is furnished by the <i>Chronicle of Battel Abbey</i>, which I
  have just translated for the press; but not one word is said of the
  sword.</p>

  <p>Though I have always lived within a few miles of Firle Place, the seat
  of the Gages, and though I am tolerably well acquainted with the history
  and traditions of that noble family, I never heard of the sword mentioned
  by P. Had that relic really been preserved at Battle till the time of
  Henry VIII., it is not improbable that it might have come into Sir John
  Gage's hands with the manor of Aleiston, of which he was grantee, while
  his son-in-law, Sir Anthony Browne, became possessor of the abbey
  itself.</p>

  <p>Will P. have the goodness to mention the source from which he obtained
  his statement?</p>

  <p>In reply to the Query respecting the sword of William the Conqueror
  (Vol. iii., p. 24.), I am enabled to inform you that the sword, and also
  the coronation robes, of William the Conqueror, were, together with the
  original "Roll of Battel," kept in the church or chapel of Battel Abbey
  until it was dismantled at the Reformation; when they were transferred to
  the part of the abbey which remained, and which became the possession and
  habitation of Sir Anthony Browne, Master of the Horse to Henry VIII.
  These precious relics continued in the possession of his descendants, who
  were created Lords Mountacute; and when Battel Abbey was sold by them to
  the ancestor of the present owner, they conveyed them to Cowdray Park,
  Sussex, where they remained until they were destroyed in the lamentable
  fire which burned down that mansion; and which, by a singular
  coincidence, took place on the same day that its owner, the last male
  representative of the Brownes Lords Mountacute, was drowned in a rash
  attempt to descend the falls of Schaffhausen in a boat.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF EISELL.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., pp. 241. 286. 315. 329)</p>

  <p>After all that has been written on this subject in "NOTES AND
  QUERIES," from MR. SINGER'S proposition of wormwood in No. 46., to MR.
  HICKSON'S approval of it in No. 51., the question remains substantially
  where Steevens and Malone had left it so many years agone.</p>

  <p>It is not necessary to discuss whether vinegar, verjuice, or wormwood
  be the preferable translation of the Shakspearian word; for before either
  of them can be received, the advocate is bound to <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span> accommodate his
  exposition to Shakspeare's sentence, and to "get over the <i>drink
  up</i>," which still stands in his way as it did in that of Malone.</p>

  <p>MR. SINGER get over the difficulty by simply saying "to <i>drink
  up</i> was commonly used for simply to <i>drink</i>." The example he
  quotes, however,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"I will drink</p>
      <p>Potions of eysell,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is not to his purpose; it is only an equivalent by the addition of the
  words "<i>potions of</i>" to give it the same definite character. Omit
  those words, and the question remains as before.</p>

  <p>MR. HICKSON (Vol. ii., p. 329.) has laid down "a canon of criticism
  for the guidance of commentators in questions of this nature," so
  appropriate and valuable, that I cannot except to be bound by it in these
  remarks; and if in the sequel his own argument (and his friend's
  proposition to boot) shall be blown up by his own petard, it will show
  the instability of the cause he has espoused.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Master the <i>grammatical construction</i> of the passage in question
  (if from a drama, in it dramatic and scenic application), deducing
  therefrom the general sense, before you attempt to amend or fix the
  meaning of a doubtful word."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Such is the canon; and Mr. HICKSON proceeds to observe, in language
  that must meet the approval of every student of the immortal bard,
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Of all writers, none exceed Shakspeare in <i>logical correctness</i>
  and nicety of expression. With a vigour of though and command of language
  attained by no man besides, it is fair to conclude, that <i>he would not
  be guilty of faults of construction such as would disgrace a schoolboy's
  composition</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With this canon so ably laid down, and these remarks so apposite, MR.
  HICKSON, taking up the weak point which Mr. SINGER had slurred over,
  observes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"<i>Drink up</i> is synonymous with <i>drink off</i>, <i>drink to the
  dregs</i>. A child taking medicine is urged to 'drink it up.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ay, exactly so; drink up what? <i>the</i> medicine; again a defined
  quantity; dregs and all,&mdash;still a <i>definite</i> quantity.</p>

  <p>MR. HICKSON proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The idea of the passage appears to be that each of the acts should go
  beyond the last preceding in extravagance.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?</p>
      <p>Woo't drink up eisell?'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and then comes the climax&mdash;'eat a crocodile?' Here is a regular
  succession of feats, the last but one of which is sufficiently wild,
  though not unheard of, and leading to the crowning extravagance. The
  notion of drinking up a river would be both unmeaning and out of
  place."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this argument two conclusions are the natural consequences:
  first, that from <i>drinking up</i> wormwood,&mdash;a feat "sufficiently
  wild but not unheard of," to eating a crocodile, is only a "regular
  succession of events;" and, secondly, that the "crowning extravagance,"
  to eat a crocodile, is, after all, neither "unmeaning" nor "out of
  place;" but, on the contrary, quite in keeping and in orderly succession
  to a "drink up" of the bitter infusion.</p>

  <p>MR. SINGER (vol. ii., p. 241.) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Numerous passages of our old dramatic writers show that it was a
  fashion with the gallants of the time to do some extravagant feat as
  proof of their love."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I quite agree with him, if he mean to say that the early dramatists
  ascribe to their gallants a fashion which in reality belongs to the age
  of Du Gueslin and the Troubadours. But Hamlet himself, in the context of
  the passage in question, gives the key to his whole purport, when, after
  some further extravagance, he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"Nay, an thoul't mouth,</p>
      <p>I'll rant as well as thou."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>That being so, why are we to conclude that each feat of daring is to
  be a tame possibility, save only the last&mdash;the crowning
  extravagance? Why not also the one preceding? Why not a feat equally of
  mere verbiage and rant? Why not a river?</p>

  <p>Adopting MR. HICKSON'S canon of criticism, the grammatical
  construction of the passage requires that a definite substantive shall be
  employed to explain the definite something that is to be done. Shakspeare
  says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Woul't drink up esile?"<a name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>&mdash;a totality in itself, without the expression of quantity to
  make it definite. If we read "drink up wormwood," what does it imply? It
  may be the smallest possible quantity,&mdash;an ordinary dose of bitters;
  or a pailful, which would perhaps meet the "madness" of Hamlet's daring.
  Thus the little monosyllable "up" must be disposed of, or a quantity must
  be expressed to reconcile MR. SINGER'S proposition with Mr. HICKSON'S
  canon and the grammatical sense of Shakspeare's line.</p>

  <p>If with Steevens we understand <i>esile</i> to be a river, "the Danish
  river <i>&#338;sil</i>, which empties itself into the Baltic," the
  <i>Yssel</i>, <i>Wessel</i>, or any other river, real or fictitious, the
  sense is clear. Rather let Shakspeare have committed a geographical
  blunder on the information of his day, than break <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span> Priscian's head by
  modern interpretation of his words. If we read "<i>drink up esile</i>" as
  one should say, "<i>woul't drink up Thames?</i>"&mdash;a task as
  reasonably impossible as setting it on fire (nevertheless a proverbial
  expression of a thirsty soul, "He'll drink the Thames dry"),&mdash;the
  task is quite in keeping with the whole tenor of Hamlet's extravagant
  rant.</p>

  <p>So the folio, according to my copy. It would be advantageous, perhaps,
  to note the spelling in the earliest edition of the sonnet whence MR.
  SINGER quotes "<i>potions of eysell</i>:" a difference, if there be any,
  would mark the distinction between Hamlet's river and the Saxon
  derivative.</p>

<h3>ALTAR LIGHTS, ETC.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 495. Vol. iii., p. 30.)</p>

  <p>The following passage from the works of a deeply pious and learned
  Caroline Divine, which I have never before seen quoted, merits, I think,
  a place in "NOTES AND QUERIES:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"As our Lord himself, so his Gospel also, is called Light, and was
  therefore anciently never read without a burning taper, '<i>etiam Sole
  rutilante</i>' ('tis Saint Hierome's testimony), though it were lighted
  in the sun.... The careful Church, perceiving that God was so much taken
  with this outward symbol of the Light, could do no less than go on with
  the ceremony. Therefore, the day of Our Lord's nativity was to be called
  <span lang="el" title="epiphania"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>, or,
  appearing of the Light; and so many tapers were to be set up the night
  before, as might give name to the vigil, '<i>Vigilia Luminum</i>'. And
  the ancients did well to send lights one to another, whatsoever some
  think of the Christmas candle. The receiving of this Light in Baptism,
  though called not usually so, but <span lang="el" title="phôtismos"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>,
  Illumination, which further to betoken the rites, were to celebrate this
  sacrament <span lang="el" title="haptomenôn pantôn tôn kêrôn"
  >&#x201B;&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>, etc., with all the tapers
  lighted, etc., as the order in the Euchologus. The Neophytus, also, or
  new convert, received a Taper lighted and delivered by the Mystagogus,
  which for the space of seven days after, he was to hold in his hand at
  Divine service, sitting in the Baptistery.</p>

  <p>"Who perceiveth not that by this right way the Tapers came into the
  Church, mysteriously placed with the Gospel upon the altar as an emblem
  of the Truer Light?...</p>

  <p>"The Funeral Tapers (however thought of by some) are of the same
  harmless import. Their meaning is, to show that the departed souls are
  not quite put out, but having walked here as the Children of the Light,
  are now going to walk before God in the Light of the Living. The sun
  never rose to the ancients, no, not so much as a candle was lighted, but
  of this signification. '<i>Vincamus</i>' was their word, whensoever the
  Lights came in; <span lang="el" title="phôs gar tên Nikên"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3C2; &#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3C1; &#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x39D;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span>, etc., for Light (saith
  Phavorinus) betokeneth victory. It was to show what trust they put in the
  Light, in whom we are more than conquerors. Our meaning is the same when,
  at the bringing in of a candle, we use to put ourselves in mind of the
  Light of Heaven: which those who list to call superstition do but 'darken
  counsel by words without knowledge.' <i>Job</i> xxxviii.
  2."&mdash;Gregorie's <i>Works</i>, 4th ed. p. 110. Lond. 1684.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I believe it is a fact, that in some churches (I hope not many) lamps
  or candles are placed on the altar <i>unlighted</i> during divine
  service. Now I would not quarrel with persons who have objections to
  altar lights, &amp;c., but I have no patience with that worse than
  superstition which would place <i>unlighted</i> candles on the
  altar,&mdash;if they symbolize any thing, it is damnation,
  excommunication, misery, and dark woe.</p>

  <p>Coming out of a church one time in which unlighted candles were
  ostentatiously displayed, I was forcibly reminded of an hieroglyphical of
  Quarles&mdash;an extinguished taper,&mdash;and under it the words,
  "<i>Sine lumine inane</i>."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"How canst thou be useful to the sight?</p>
      <p>What is the taper not endued with light?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I can hardly refrain from quoting here a beautiful passage from
  Wordsworth:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Our ancestors within the still domain</p>
      <p>Of vast cathedral, or conventual gloom,</p>
      <p>Their vigils kept: when tapers day and night</p>
      <p>On the dim altar burn'd continually,</p>
      <p>In token that the house was evermore</p>
      <p>Watching to God. Religious men were they,</p>
      <p>Nor would their reason, tutor'd to aspire</p>
      <p>Above this transitory world, allow</p>
      <p>That there should pass a moment of the year</p>
      <p>When in their land the Almighty's service ceased."</p>

  <p><i>Handbell before a Corpse</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.).&mdash;It is
  usual, at the funeral of any member of the University of Oxford, for the
  University marshal and bellman to attend in the character of
  <i>mutes</i>. As the procession moves along, the latter rings his bell at
  about half-minute time. I have witnessed it also when the deceased has
  been one of the family of a member of the University, and when he has
  been a matriculated person. I have never considered it as anything but
  <i>a cast of the bellman's office</i>, to add more solemnity to the

  the county of Devon, is one to the memory of Ann, wife of Francis
  Pengelly, and daughter of Sir George Downing of East Hatley in the county
  of Cambridge, who died the 23rd of November, 1702; with the arms of
  Pengelly impaling Barry of six argent and gules, over all a wyvern

  <p>Nicholas Downing of Exeter College, vicar of Kingsteignton, in Devon,
  who died in 1666, and was buried there, seems to have been of another
  family, as he bore a very different coat of arms.</p>

  <p>A Lieut. Downing was buried in Charles church, Plymouth, in 1799, but
  the arms on his monument are not the same as either of the above.</p>

  <p>Other than these, I know of none of the name, ancient or recent, in
  the county, and I shall be glad to learn on what ground Sir George
  Downing's family is said to be of most ancient origin in Devonshire. The
  name does not appear in Westcote, Pole, Prince, Risdon, or the Heralds'
  visitations, and the modern authorities state that the family was from
  Essex or Norfolk.</p>

  <p>The following memorandum I found accidentally on the margin of a MS.

  whence I obtained it. Possibly, however, it may assist "ALPHA" in his
  enquiry.</p>

  Helaugh Nichols, an excellent authority in such matters, whose trade
  traditions, through the Boyers, father and son, went back a century and a
  half, tells us that the ballad was supposed to have been written by Henry
  Woodfall, while an apprentice to Darby. The Darbys were printers time out
  of mind&mdash;one Robert Darby was probably an assistant to Wynkyn de
  Worde, who certainly left a legacy to a person of that name. The
  Woodfalls, too, can be traced up as printers for nearly two centuries.
  <i>The</i> Darby, and Joan, his wife, were probably John Darby, printer,
  in Bartholomew Close, who was <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Russell's Speech," and died in 1704. <i>The</i> Woodfall, the printer, is

  the supposed origin of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, the result of which
  I hope ere long will appear, tells me that he is decidedly of opinion
  that the <i>Visions</i> in question are not the production of the "prince
  of dreamers."</p>

  <p>He believes the <i>Visions</i> first appeared as Bunyan's in a
  stereotyped collection or selection of his works, about 1820-8. Some time
  after seeing this, my friend was surprised at meeting with the following
  little volume, which is now before me: <i>The World to Come. The Glories
  of Heaven, and the Terrors of Hell, lively displayed under the Similitude
  of a Vision</i>. By G.L., Sunderland. Printed by R. Wetherald, for H.
  Creighton, 1771. 12mo. The running title, as far as p. 95., is, <i>The
  World to Come; or, Visions of Heaven</i>; and on that page commence the
  <i>Visions of Hell, and of the Torments of the Damned</i>: and here it is
  the author has <i>charitably</i> placed Hobbes, with whom the colloquy
  alluded to by your querist occurs.</p>

  <p>I shall not occupy your papers with any remarks on the ignorance
  betrayed by G.L. (whoever he may be), both of the writings and character
  of Hobbes; but I shall be glad if I can lead to the elucidation of what
  yet remains a literary obscurity, and obtains the name of G.L.</p>

  <p><i>Holland Land</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 267. 345.; Vol. iii., p.

  <p>The <i>polders</i> of Holland are familiar to all travellers, as lands
  lying below the level of the sea, once a mere morass, redeemed from that
  state, and brought into cultivation by embankments, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In another charter, somewhat earlier in date and relating to the same
  district, viz. the neighbourhood of Winchelsea, Hamo de Crevecour speaks
  of lands in La more in Ideun, which the monks of Robertsbridge, with
  consent of his father Hamo, "a mari incluserunt."</p>

  <p>I have always supposed that the "terra Flandrensis" of my charter
  signified land of the same description as the Dutch polders; the art of
  thus redeeming land being probably introduced from the Low Countries. It
  is not unlikely that, in that day, lands so brought into cultivation were
  designated as "terre Flandrenses," and the term afterwards anglicised
  into "Holland Land."</p>

  considered as "divino spiritu afflati," and made "duces viæ in

  eyewitness that is not perfectly credible. When he quotes Pliny for
  monsters, the Chronicles for legends, and the romances of his time for
  narratives of an extraordinary character, he does so in evident good
  faith as a compiler. His most improbable statements, too, are always
  qualified with some such phrase as "men seyn, but I have not sene it." In
  a word, I believe Sir John Maundevile to have been as truthful in
  intention as any writer of his age. I am afraid that J.M.G.'s knowledge
  of our old "voiager" is limited to some jest-book of more modern times,
  which attributes to him sayings and doings of which he is perfectly
  guiltless.</p>

  <p><i>Cockade and True Blue</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 7. 27.) both owe their
  origin to the wars of the Scottish Covenanters; and the cockade appears
  to have been first adopted as a distinguishing emblem by the English army
  at the battle of Sherra-muir, where the Scotch wore the blue ribbon as a
  scarf, or on their bonnets (which was their favourite colour). The
  English army then, to distinguish themselves, assumed a black rosette on
  their hats; which, from its position, the Scotch nick-named a "cock'ade"
  (with which our use of the word "cockscomb" is connected) and is still

  <p><i>The Vavasours of Hazlewood (Vol. ii., p. 326.).</i>&mdash;1. It is

  Vavasour family. To commemorate this, there is, under the west window in
  that cathedral, a statue of the owner of Hazelwood at that period,

  the edition of 1576, in my possession, is "Imprinted by <i>Christopher

  the Tygres Head."</p>

  <p>The text quoted varies also in two or three words from my copy, and it
  is probably from the Geneva edition. The English edition of 1576 runs
  thus, (Gen. iii. 7.): "Then the eyes of them <i>both</i> were opened, and

  <p><i>Histoire des Sévarambes</i> (Vol. iii., p. 4.).&mdash;On the
  subject of the authorship of this work I will transcribe a note which I
  subjoined to a short account of Isaac Vossius (Worthington's
  <i>Diary</i>, p. 125):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Whether the History of the Sevarites, of Sevarambi by Captains Thomas
  Liden, published in two parts (London, 1675-9, 12mo.), which is one of
  the ablest of the fictions written after the model of More's
  <i>Utopia</i>, and which has been ascribed to Isaac Vossius by J.A.
  Fabricius, be his, is a point yet unsettled. On a careful consideration
  of the internal evidence, and a comparison with his avowed publications,
  so far as such a comparison can be made between works so dissimilar in
  character, I incline to the conclusion that this tract is justly ascribed
  to Isaac Vossius."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On a reconsideration of the subject, I see no reason to alter this
  opinion. Morhof, who always attributed it to Isaac Vossius (see
  Polyhistor, vol. i. p. 74., edit. 1747), was thoroughly versed in the
  literary history, including the English, of the period, and was not
  likely to have been mistaken. Vossius lived in England from 1670 to 1688,
  when he died. I have seen several English letters of his, though his
  general correspondence was in Latin or French, and he seems quite able to
  have written it, as far as the language is concerned. Vairasse appears to
  have translated it into French but to have had no other part in it. I may
  observe, that the publication in English, London, 1738, is a
  retranslation from the French, not a reprint of the original work of
  1675-9.</p>

  <p class="author">JAMES CROSSLEY.</p>

  <p><i>Verses attributed to Charles Yorke</i> (Vol. ii., p. 7.; and Vol.
  iii., p. 43.).&mdash;These lines, "Stript to the naked soul," have been
  frequently printed, indeed so lately as in Lord Campbell's <i>Lives of
  the Chancellors</i>, at the end of the Life of Charles Yorke, as his, but
  without any observation. What is most singular is, that the excellent
  editor of Bishop Warburton's <i>Literary Remains</i> has overlooked the
  fact that they are driven in that prelate's correspondence with Bishop
  Hurd as Pope's. (See <i>Letters</i>, p. 362., edit. 1809, 8vo.) Warburton
  observes, "The little poem is certainly his." He remarks in a letter to
  Yorke&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"You have obliged me much (as is your wont) by a fine little poem of
  my excellent and endeared friend, Mr. Pope, and I propose to put in into
  use."&mdash;<i>Letters from Warburton to C. Yorke</i>. 1812, 4to. p.
  64.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Warburton then gave them to Ruffhead, who inserted them in his <i>Life
  of Pope</i>, from which they were transferred in Bowles's editions of
  <i>Pope's Works</i> (vol. ii. p. 406), and in the supplementary volume to
  <i>Pope's Works</i> (1807, 4to.). The extraordinary circumstance is, that
  they had appeared as far back as 1753 in the miscellaneous works of Aaron
  Hill, published in 1753, in 4 vols. 8vo., and are included in that
  collection as his own. Roscoe observes (Life of Pope, in vol. i. of his
  edition of <i>Pope's Works</i>, p. 361., edit. 1824), without, however
  appearing to have been fully acquainted with the facts of the case:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"These verses are not the production of Pope, as might indeed readily
  have been perceived, but of Aaron Hill."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I must confess I cannot agree with the remark. If the point be to be
  decided by internal evidence, the verses are surely Pope's. The
  collection of A. Hill's miscellaneous works was a posthumous one for the
  benefit of the family, and includes several other poems, which were
  certainly not written by him. Little stress, therefore, can be laid upon
  the fact of the lines being included in this collection, which seems to
  have comprised whatever was found amongst Hill's papers, without any nice
  examination or scrutiny. My conclusion is, that the verses are Pope's;
  and it is at all events certain that they are not Charles Yorke's.</p>

  and infer that he probably did so from some manifestation of amorous
  propensities on the part of that reformer.</p>

  <p>A querist in your last number (J.C.R.) points out that D'Aubigné, or
  his translator, spells the word <i>Fallicus</i>, and refers it to the
  deceitful character of Farel.</p>

  <p><i>Phallicus</i> is a Greek word, and has a meaning&mdash;<span
  lang="el" title="phallikos"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>, of or
  belonging to the <span lang="el" title="phallos"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. <i>Fallicus</i>, to
  the best of my knowledge, is neither Greek nor Latin, and has no meaning.
  Erasmus, in his epistles, constantly spells the word <i>Phallicus</i>.
  (See <i>Epp.</i> 698. 707. &amp;c. Leyden, ed. 1706.) And that I was
  justified in drawing from it an inference which is in analogy with its
  meaning, the following passages, in the last of the epistles just cited,
  will establish:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Hunc stomachum in me concepit (Phallicus) quod in <i>spongia</i>

  case, their minds are, as it were, put into the stocks, like their feet
  at the dancing-school, and the moral always consists in good moral
  conduct being crowned with temporal success. Truth is, I would not give
  one tear shed over <i>Little Red Riding-Hood</i> for all the benefit to
  be derived from a hundred Histories of Jemmy Goodchild.... In a word, I
  think the selfish tendencies will be soon enough acquired in this

  <p><i>William Chilcot</i> (Vol. iii., p. 38.).&mdash;MR. HOOPER is
  referred to the History of Tiverton, by Lieut. Col. Harding, ed. Boyce,
  Tiverton; Whittaker, London, 1847, vol. ii., B. III., p. 167., for an
  account of the family of Chilcot <i>alias</i> Comyn; to which most likely
  the author belonged, and was probably a native of Tiverton. As MR. HOOPER
  many not have ready access to the book, I send the substance of an
  extract. Robert Chilcott <i>alias</i> Comyn, born at Tiverton, com.
  Devon, merchant, and who died, it is supposed, at Isleworth, com.
  Middlesex, about A.D. 1609, "married Ann, d. of Walter Cade of London,
  Haberdasher, by whom he had one son, <i>William</i>, who married
  Catherine, d. of Thomas Billingsly of London, Merchant, and had issue."
  Certain lands also in Tiverton, A.D. 1680-90, are described as "now or
  late of William Comyns <i>alias</i> Chilcott."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> p.
  61.</p>

  <p>If the first edition of the work were in 1698, most likely the author
  was a grandson of the above-named William Chilcot and Catherine his wife,
  which the Tiverton registers might show. If the search prove unsuccessful
  there, try that of Watford, Herts, where a branch of the same family was
  settled, and to which there are monuments in Watford churchyard.</p>

  Pembridge, and spelt <i>Mocker</i> by W.M.</p>

  <p><i>Mole</i> (Vol. ii., p. 225.).&mdash;This story is of course much
  older than the form which it now appears. Sir Bevil Grenville is the
  great hero of the N.W. coast of Cornwall most of the floating legend has
  been gathered about him.</p>

  <p>Legends referring to the origin of different animals are common. Mrs.
  Jamieson (Canada) has a very beautiful Chippewa story of the first

  <p><i>Pillgarlick</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.; Vol. iii., p. 42.).&mdash;The
  word is given by Todd, in his edition of Johnson, under the forms
  <i>Pilgarlick</i> and <i>Pilled-garlick</i>. The same orthography is
  adopted by other lexicographers. The spelling, concerning which your
  querist desires information, is, however, the least important point. I
  trust that the question will elicit information of a valuable kind as to
  the origin of the term, by which I have I myself been sorely puzzled, and
  which, I think, has not been satisfactorily cleared up by any of those
  who have attempted it. Following the authority of Skinner, our
  philologists are satisfied with assuring us, that <i>pilled</i> means
  bald (French, pelé) and about this there can be no dispute. Thus Chaucer
  (Reve's Tale) says:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Round was his face, and camuse was his nose,</p>
      <p>And <i>pilled</i> as an ape was his skull."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Shakspeare also has:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Pieled priest! doost thou command me to be shut out?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>for "shaven priest." But <i>pilled</i>, in other cases as might be
  shown by quotations, which for the sake of brevity I omit, means
  <i>pillaged</i>, <i>robbed</i>, and also <i>peeled</i>, of which last
  sense the quotations above given seem only to be a figurative
  application. The difficulties which arise from these explanations are,
  first, if <i>bald</i> be the true meaning, why must we, with Todd, limit
  it to baldness, resulting from disease, or more especially (as Grose will
  have it) from a disgraceful disease?</p>

  <p>Secondly, if <i>peeled</i> be taken as the equivalent to
  <i>pilled</i>, why is peeled garlick a more perfect type of misery than
  any other peeled root or fruit?</p>

  <p>Thirdly, if <i>pillage</i> is an essential ingredient in the true
  meaning of the term "pilled garlick," what has the stolen garlick to do
  with wretchedness? And,</p>

  <p>Lastly, how will any one, or all of these explanations together, tally
  with the following passage from Skelton:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Wyll, Wyll, Wyll, Wyll, Wyll</p>

  recent novel; and J.S. (p. 285) informs him that the title is <i>Le Morne
  au Diable</i>, by Eugène Sue. The fact is, that "La Morne au Diable" is
  the principal scene of the events described, and nothing more. The title
  is <i>L'Aventurier, ou la Barbe-bleue</i>; and an English translation,
  styled the <i>Female Blue Beard, or the Adventurer</i>, was published in

  <p><i>Tablet to Napoleon</i> (Vol. i., p. 461.).&mdash;The form and
  punctuation given to this inscription by C. suggest its true meaning.
  Napoleon is called the Egyptian, the Italian, for reasons similar to
  those for which Publius Cornelius Scipio obtained the name of
  "Africanus." There is, however, another sense in which the epithet "bis
  Italicus" is applicable to Napoleon: he was an Italian by birth as well
  as by conquest. It is in this sense that Voltaire has applied to Henri
  Quatre the second line of the following couplet:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Je chante ce héros qui régna sur la France</p>
      <p>Et par droit de <i>conquête</i>, et par droit de <i>naissance</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As to the "lingual purity" of the inscription, there is not much to be
  said about it, one way or the other. It is on a level with most modern
  inscriptions and epitaphs in the Latin language; neither so elegant as
  the Latinity of Dr. Johnson, or Walter Savage Landor, nor yet so
  hackneyed as our "Latin de cuisine."</p>

  <p><i>North Sides of Churchyards</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 55. &amp;c.)&mdash;In
  a chapter on the custom of burying on the south side of churches, in
  Thompson's <i>History of Swine</i>, published 1824, I find the following
  mention of the north side being appropriated to felons:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The writer hereof remembers, that between fifty and sixty years ago,
  a man who was executed at Lincoln, was brought to Swine, and buried on
  the north side of the church, as the proper place in which to bury a
  felon."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have heard it stated by several inhabitants of the parish, that it
  is only within a few years that burials began to be made irrespectively
  on the north side. Whilst speaking of things in connection with this
  church, I may mention for the <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span> interest of antiquaries, that only a short
  time ago, the sexton discovered a very curious fresco of the Virgin on
  one of the pillars in the north aisle. There is an inscription beneath
  the figure, but so very indistinct, as not to admit of being
  deciphered.</p>

  the <i>owner</i> of the estate? If so, did she die in the lifetime of her

  no direct heirs, the estate would escheat. Was the King lord of the fee?
  Were William de Warburton and Ingelram de Monceaux relatives of the
  <i>half</i> blood of Juliana? If so, a re-grant to them, if claimants,
  would not, I imagine, have been unusual upon payment of a fine to the
  crown. It would almost seems as if a doubt existed as to the heirship,
  from the expression "<i>whose next of kin they </i>SAY<i> they are</i>."

  <p><i>Grassum</i> is the term commonly used in the northern parts of the

  <p><i>Swans hatched during Thunder</i> (Vol. ii., p. 510.).&mdash;Some
  years ago I purchased a pair of swans, and, during the first breeding
  season after I procured them, they made a nest in which they deposited
  seven eggs. After they had been sitting about six weeks, I observed to my
  servant, who had charge of them and the other water-fowl, that it was
  about the time for the swans to hatch. He immediately said, that it was
  no use expecting it till there had been a rattling peal of thunder to
  crack the egg-shells, as they were so hard and thick that it was
  impossible for the cygnets to break them without some such assistance.
  Perhaps this is the reason why swans are said to be hatched during a
  thunder-storm. I need only say, that this is a popular fallacy, as swans
  regularly hatch after sitting six weeks, whether there happens to be a
  thunder-storm or not.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of Apricot</i> (Vol. ii., p. 420.).&mdash;I cannot agree
  in the opinion expressed by your correspondent E.C.H., that this word is
  derived from the Latin <i>præcox</i>, signifying
  "early-ripening,"&mdash;that the words <span lang="el" title="prokokkia"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  and <span lang="el" title="prekokkia"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  are <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span> Græcised Latin,&mdash;and that the Arabs
  themselves, adopting the word with a slight variation, made it
  <i>al-bercoy</i>.</p>

  <p>The fact of the fruit itself being of Asiatic origin, renders it in
  the highest degree improbable that the Orientals would borrow a name for
  it from the Latin.</p>

  <p>My own opinion is, that the reverse is the case&mdash;that the Latin
  is merely a corruption of the Arabic; and that the Latins, in adopting
  the word, naturally gave it the slight alteration which rendered the
  Arabic word, to them unmeaning, appropriately significant of the nature
  of the fruit.</p>

  <p>I find that in various languages the word strolls thus in the Latin of
  the middle age, <i>avercoccius</i>&mdash;in the modern Greek, <span
  lang="el" title="berykokkion"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3BA;&#x3BA;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>&mdash;in
  the Italian, <i>albercocco</i>, <i>albicocca</i>&mdash;in the Spanish,
  <i>albaricoque</i>&mdash;and all these various words, undeducible from
  the Latin <i>præcox</i>, are readily derivable from the Arabic word, the
  prefix <i>al</i>, which is merely the article, being in some cases
  dropped, and in others retained.</p>

  <p>I may add, as a curious fact, that, in the south of Italy, of which I
  am a native, the common people call the apricot <i>verricocca</i>, and
  <i>the peach</i> <i>precucco</i>, although the former ripen
  <i>earlier</i> than the latter.</p>

  passage which was given as quotation from Bishop Hall. I transcribe it,
  as it appears to me to approach nearer to the above hexameter than even
  Gray's lines:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There is many a rich stone laid up, in the bowels of the earth; many
  a fair pearl in the bosom of the sea, that never was seen, nor ever shall
  be."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Time when Herodotus wrote</i> (Vol. ii., p. 405.).&mdash;The
  passage in Herodotus which shows that he was still employed on his
  history when he was seventy-five, is in his first book. But A.W.H.
  thinks, that, as it is a general introduction, showing why he mentioned
  all places, small or great, it must have been written at the beginning. I
  should infer the contrary; that he would give an account why he had done
  so after he had done it, and not while it rested merely in intention.</p>

  <p>But perhaps it may be said, that <span lang="el" title="ên"
  >&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span> is in the former part of the sentence, and
  therefore might have been repeated in the latter part, which is the
  converse of it, though it might not be exactly the proper tense.</p>

  <p>However, F. Clinton puts down his birth B.C. 484; 452 or 456 as the
  years in which he read his history at the Olympic Games; and 408 as a
  year in which he was still adding to it.</p>

  <p>However, if he wrote the passage when he was thirty, that would
  justify the past tense, which perhaps, too, we have a right to construe
  <i>have been</i>, for that verb has no perfect preterite.</p>

  particulars.</p>

  <p>There is a copy in the British Museum (Press Mark, case 21. b.) of a

  out of Latine into Englishe by William Adlington. Imprinted at London, in
  Fleet streate, and the sign of the Oliphante, by Henry Wykes. Anno

  the following&mdash;"Grassor in possessionem agri"&mdash;which would be
  rendered, "To enter upon it by force;" it being only by the payment of
  the fine (Grasson) that the entry, "Grassor," or alienation of copyhold
  lands, could be warded off: hence the act of the lord of the manor
  (Grassor) became the name for the fine paid by this tenant,
  "Grasson."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The landing of Charles Edward Stuart, and the "Seven Men of Moidart,"
  on the memorable 25th July, 1745, was the opening of the last, and, in
  many respects, the most brilliant and stirring chapter in the Romance of
  English History. That Mr. Murray has therefore done wisely in the
  publication, in a separate form, of <i>The Forty-Five: by Lord Mahon,
  being the Narrative of the Insurrection of 1745, extracted from Lord
  Mahon's History of England</i>, there can be little doubt. The memory of
  that eventful period is so kept alive among us, by snatches of Jacobite
  ballads, and recitals of the strange incidents in which it was so rich,
  that this separate publication of so much of Lord Mahon's <i>History of
  England from the Peace of Utrecht (1713) to the Peace of Paris (1763)</i>
  as relates to its "moving accidents by flood and field," will be a great
  boon to those numerous readers who have neither means, time, nor
  opportunity to peruse Lord Mahon's interesting narrative in that valuable
  contribution to our national history for which it was originally
  written.</p>

  <p>Some time since the British Museum purchased for about 120<i>l.</i> a
  volume containing no less than sixty-four early French Farces and
  Moralities, printed between the year 1542 and 1548, of which a very large
  proportion was entirely unknown. How important a collection of materials
  for the early history of the Drama, especially in France, is contained in
  this precious volume, we learn from a work which has reached us, "<i>pas
  destiné au commerce</i>," under the title of <i>Description
  Bibliographique et Analyse d'un Livre unique qui se trouve au Musée
  Britannique</i>, which contains a short but able analysis of the various
  pieces which formed the volume thus fortunately secured for our national
  library. Though the name of the editor is stated, on the title-page, to
  be <i>Tridace-Nafe-Théobrome, Gentilhomme Breton</i>, we strongly suspect
  that no such gentleman is to be found; and that we are really indebted
  for this highly curious and interesting book to a gentleman who has
  already laid the world of letters under great obligation, M. Delpierre,
  the accomplished Secretary of Legation of the Belgian Embassy.</p>

  <p>Literature, Science, and the Arts have sustained a heavy loss in the
  death of that accomplished patron of them&mdash;that most amiable
  nobleman the Marquess of Northampton. His noble simplicity and
  single-mindedness of character, and his unaffected kindliness of manner,
  endeared him to all who had the good fortune to be honoured with his
  acquaintance, and by all of whom his death will be long and most deeply
  regretted.</p>

  immediate publication, by Subscription, of the <i>Consuetudines Kanciæ: a

  Kent</i>.</p>

  <p>WHERE TO BUY A DRESSING CASE.</p>

  <p>In no article perhaps is caution more necessary than in the purchase
  of a Dressing Case, for in none are the meretricious arts of the
  unprincipled manufacturer more frequently displayed. MECHI, 4. LEADENHALL
  STREET, near Gracechurch Street, has long enjoyed the reputation of
  producing a Dressing Case in the most finished and faultless manner.
  Those who purchase of him will be sure of having thoroughly-seasoned and
  well-prepared wood or leather, with the fittings of first-rate quality.
  The prices range from 1<i>l.</i> to 100<i>l.</i> Thus the man of fortune
  and he of moderate means may alike be suited, while the traveller will
  find the Mechian Dressing Case especially adapted to his
  necessities.&mdash;4. LEADENHALL STREET.</p>

  <p>The Tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer in Westminster Abbey is fast mouldering
  into irretrievable decay. A sum of One Hundred Pounds, will effect a
  perfect repair. The Committee have not thought it right to fix any limit
  to the contribution; they themselves have opened the list with a
  subscription from each of them of Five Shillings; but thy will be ready
  to receive any amount, more or less, which those who value poetry and
  honour Chaucer may be kind enough to remit to them.</p>

  <p>Subscriptions have been received from the Earls of Carlisle,
  Ellesmere, and Shaftesbury, Viscounts Strangford and Mahon, Pres. Soc.
  Antiq., The Lords Braybrooke and Londesborough, and many other noblemen
  and gentlemen.</p>

  <p>Subscriptions are received by all the members of the Committee, and at
  the Union Bank, Pall Mall East. Post-office orders may be made payable at

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
